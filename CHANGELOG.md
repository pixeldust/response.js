# CHANGELOG | [current](https://github.com/pixeldust/response.js/blob/master/response.js) 

## [0.3.0.20120224](https://github.com/pixeldust/response.js/commit/f3cd922b2f403b8d219feac08afb630779f37f9e#response.js) (2012-02-24)
- Created my fork from [ryanve](https://github.com/ryanve) (Ryan Van Etten) 0.3.0 version.
- [Response.create](http://responsejs.com/#create) now accepts the optional `'usedpr'` parameter. Using `'usedpr: true'` in an [Response.create](http://responsejs.com/#create) object forces breakpoint matches to take into account the pixel density ratio of the device, i.e calculate actual width/height of the device. For example: on a retina device this means the device dimensions 320x480 are treated as 480x960.

## [0.2.9](https://github.com/ryanve/response.js/commit/6d483eee4eb0e60b96d3b251d8f3bad168fc0fda#response.js) (2011-01-02)
- [Fixed issue reading data-responsejs attribute](https://github.com/ryanve/response.js/issues/3).
- Added new boolean methods: 
  - `Response.wave` tests viewport `height` ranges (vertical equivalent to [Response.band](http://responsejs.com/#band))
  - `Response.device.wave` tests `device-height` ranges 
  - `Response.device.band` tests `device-width` ranges 
- Breakpoints can now be based on any of the propsâ€”in addition to `'width'` and `'device-pixel-ratio'` the [Response.create](http://responsejs.com/#create) `prop` parameter now accepts `'height'`, `'device-width'`, and `'device-height'`.

## [0.2.8](https://github.com/ryanve/response.js/commit/088c80427ada40f9a6d38b44f7502c14a9f0bc70#response.js) (2011-12-17)
- Added local function for handling range comparison in preparation for new methods in 0.2.9.
- `Response.decide` loop optimized.
- Removed depreciated [Response.affix](https://github.com/ryanve/response.js/issues/1) method.

## [0.2.7](https://github.com/ryanve/response.js/commit/0885b9c17fd85c85f23753720ca3f27f33bdc4cd#response.js) (2011-10-26)
- Error handling was improved. Now, most of the public methods will throw an exception to the console if the args sent to them are incorrect. The exception says the name of the method that caused the problem and when possible the name of the arg preceded by an @ sign.
- Some issues with device-pixel-ratio [decimals](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7907180/retain-precision-during-numeric-sort) and were resolved. Response.target was updated with the ability to target data keys containing decimal points. [They needed to be escaped.](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/76) Response.create now properly supports device-pixel-ratio based attributes. Response.dpr was further optimized.

## [0.2.6](https://github.com/ryanve/response.js/commit/28feb9d5608149c175a57d99383007bd90366b4a#response.js) (2011-10-24)
- The default attribute setups were eliminated in favor of letting devs choose their own setup options (breakpoints etc.) either via Response.create or by passing the custom setup options in a JSON object stored in a data attribute on the body tag. The latter method is preferrable because it requires no scripting.
- The Response.create method was reworked to accomodate the ability to pass args via an object (or an array of objects) so that devs can better understand its use and so that it would be more efficient at creating multiple attribute sets (it now only triggers the ready event once). The original string args still work, but going forward, objects will be preferred.
- Some methods (ones mainly for internal operations) were localized for efficiency:
  - Response.format REPLACED w/ local var sortNums
  - Response.send REPLACED w/ local var applyActive
  - Response.swap REPLACED w/ local var swapEach
- Response.mins REPLACED w/ Response.mapBool (which is more general and thus better suited as a method).
- Response.band was made more efficient by eliminating the check for .matchMedia. (Checking the window width always works.)
- Minor performance tweaks were made.

## [0.2.5](https://github.com/ryanve/response.js/commit/a8790261b4c850aff2dd9be3a7512fa5118d6a01#response.js) (2011-09-20)
